<h1>Dublin Bus - Dynamic Travel-Time Predictor & Application</h1>

**Project Technical Considerations:**
* *Python (pandas, stats-model, sci-kit learn)* 
* *Django*
* *Jupyter Notebook*
* *HTML5*
* *CSS3*
* *Bootsrap* 
* *JavaScript (jQuery)*
* *MySQL*
* *Ubuntu 14.04 server*
* *Nginx & Gunicorn*


**Project Specification:**
Bus companies produce schedules which contain generic travel times. Of course, there are many variables which determine how long the actual journey will take. Traffic
conditions which are affected by the time of day, day of the week, month of the year and the weather play an important role in determining how long the journey will take.
These factors along with the dynamic nature of the events on the road network make it difficult to efficiently plan trips on public transport modes which interact with other traffic.

This project involves
* *analysing historic Dublin Bus GPS data [1] and* 
* *weather data [2] inorder to create dynamic travel time estimates.*

Based on data analysis of historic Dublin bus GPS data, a system which when presented with any bus route, departure time, day of the week, current weather condition, produces an
accurate estimate of travel time for thecomplete route. Users should be able to interact with the system via a web-based interface which is optimised
for mobile devices. When presented with any bus route, an origin stop and a destination stop, a time, a day of the week, current weather, the system should produce and display via the interface an accurate
estimate of travel time for the selected journey.
